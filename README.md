Note: What we do for these heatmaps is take SD + DDB filtered  look at the 120-130GeV peak compared to rest of data. Given "rest of data" is very little data after DDB and SD cuts, I wouldn't trust these distributions just yet. This is proof of concept and I will sum heatmaps over many higgs producing files.

Also, the larger plots take long to generate... ~30min-1hr. But this is not a problem as I need only one and then I either plot smaller interesting sections of the heatmap or I find a z_cut/beta combination I like and sum over that specific combination.
